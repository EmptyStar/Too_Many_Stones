# Too Many Stones

This mod is in a functional state, but not a polished state. It currently features 14 stone types that all spawn in the world, cobble for most of them, and bricks and blocks for all stone types. The placement of the stones is not final. More stones may be added, and you can put a feature request for new ones.
