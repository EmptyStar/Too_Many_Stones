based on code from Minetest game, all walls mod, and geodes mod. Textures created by JoeEnderman with Stable Diffusion (rough versions), Gimp (cleaning up from the others), Planet Minecraft (block and brick variants), and Blockbench (cobblestones, granites, and cracked bricks). From V0.2.2+: Many textures have been cleaned up or made using Libresprite. It may replace all but Gimp in future TMS releases. Code rebase with help from Mineclone2 and Minebase. All node sounds are CC0 and sourced from opengameart.org, freesound.org, and myself. Some are a combination of both. Yes, they are all CC0, I checked the online ones, and mine (nearly half) I can decide for myself because I am big boi.
