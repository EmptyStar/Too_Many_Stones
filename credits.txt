based on code from Minetest game, all walls mod, and geodes mod. Textures created by JoeEnderman with Stable Diffusion (rough versions), Gimp (cleaning up from the others), Planet Minecraft (block and brick variants), and Blockbench (cobblestones, granites, and cracked bricks). From V0.2.2+: Many textures have been cleaned up or made using Libresprite. It may replace all but Gimp in future TMS releases.
